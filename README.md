# Final Proejct for the course "Complex Networks: Big Data modelling and learning"

This repository contains the project for the exam "Complex Networks: Big Data modelling and learning"
held through June 20220 by Prof. Amoroso for the XXXVI cycle of the PhD Program in Physics at University of Bari.

The repository contains two Jupiter notebooks, one for a network analysis of 2d molecular dynamics simulations of colloidal particles
and another one with a Neural Network implementation of a classifier for the dataset of the same simulations

## Network Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Colloidal 2d Systems

All the relevant code and explanations is contained in the notebook `network_analysis.ipynb`.

## Phase Identification Classifier

All the relevant code is contained in the notebook `phase_identification.ipynb`.
